This is my summary!

Many were intron variants and ignored as Li et al ignored anything that wasn't an exome (i.e., ignoring intron variants and intergenic variants and 3'UTR variants, upstream gene variants).  I also ignored synonymous mutations.

For variant 183, I got several genes that pass the filter:



chr11	77962948 was a missense mutation in Sez6 as was chr11	77975319	.	G	A.


For variant 1449:
chr11	77975323	.	T	C was a missense variant in Sez6.

For variant 1526:
chr11	77975319	.	G	A was a missense variant in Sez6
