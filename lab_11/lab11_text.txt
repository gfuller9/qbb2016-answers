Hi.

It looks like there are 4 blocks based on the hierarchical clustering (one of which encompasses more than half of the dataset).  So, I will use 4 blocks for the K-means.

It doesn't look like k-means is appropriate here.  There are 2 clusters (red and dark blue) that appear to be appropriate.  However, the light blue overlaps a lot with the red and the yellow is clearly multiple clusters.  Therefore, the clustering with k-means didn't really work.

So, they used a p-value of 0.05 cutoff along with an additional filter of ratio change.  If a gene had greater than or equal to 2.0 fold enrichment or 0.5 fold anti-enrichment (is that a word?), they considered it differentially expressed.
It looks to me like the earliest two are CFU and MYS.  The latest are POLY and UNK.

Panther output for the MOST ENRICHED GENE:
 	MOUSE|MGI=MGI=1916948|UniProtKB=Q9D6X5 	SLC52A3
	Solute carrier family 52, riboflavin transporter, member 3
Slc52a3
ortholog 	SOLUTE CARRIER FAMILY 52, RIBOFLAVIN TRANSPORTER, MEMBER 3 (PTHR12929:SF13) 	G-protein coupled receptor 	Mus musculus

Since this is a GPCR, it is most likely involved in signaling of some sort (the name in our dataset was not the PANTHER recognized name).  Specifically, it is involved in transporting riboflavin.  This is odd as this protein should be constitutively expressed.  Riboflavin is a necessary cofactor in some metabolic processes.  Perhaps some of these differentiated cells are more metabolically active or are involved in distributing riboflavin throughout the body of the organism.  Most of the literature describes phenotypes including neurological conditions in humans with mutations in this gene.  It is an essential gene, and therefore difficult to study.  It seems to be the product of differentiation rather than something that causes differentiation based on these observations.  The larger scale panther search identified a lot of genes involved in signaling, so those are likely part of what is driving differentiations.
